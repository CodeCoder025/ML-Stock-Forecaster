# ML Stock Forecaster Project!

Second version, as an upgrade to my first (which has already been deleted). In this version, I plan to move beyond standard OHLC data, creating features like SMA, EMA, CCI, and adding extra non-derived metrics such as price movements of pairs, TICK, TRIN, and Dow-Emini.
Hopefully model will perform better than pervious one, and actually be able to generate some alpha if deployed to a backtesting engine!
