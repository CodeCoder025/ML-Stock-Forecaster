#This weight analysis function analyses weights by feature, whereas default weight dictionary displays weights by model.

#Idea:
#Can try to optimize accuracy of predictions by creating my own ML model which randomly swaps weights generated by the two models, then computes predictions to see if loss function is minimized. Can also create a regressor which takes the average of weights created by these models.
